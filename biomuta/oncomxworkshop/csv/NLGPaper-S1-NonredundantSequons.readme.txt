Summary

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This table was generated as part of the supporting information to accompany submission of the manuscript titled "Loss and Gain of N-linked Glycosylation Sequons due 
to Single-nucleotide Variation in Cancer." This manuscript describes the workflow for identifying all possible N-linked glycosylation (NLG) sequons described in the given table.
This table contains 59,341 NLGs identified by one of three methods: high-confidence NLGs (previously reported in databases with accompanying validated evidence or manual assertion tags),
NLGs predicted by NetNGlyc (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/), and custom scripts to identify all NXS/T (X!=P) sequons by string search.
