Summary

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These tables were generated as part of the supporting information to accompany submission of the manuscript titled "Loss and Gain of N-linked Glycosylation
Sequons due to Single-nucleotide Variation in Cancer.The manuscript describes the subset of somatic-only LOG and GOG variants that appear across at least three cancer types in the below table. 
This table contains 41 somatic variants predicted to cause a gain of the consensus NXS/T motif at that position in at least three cancer types.
 These variants include ONLY those somatic variants WITHOUT germline variants occurring at the same positions occurring in three or more cancers.
