Taller bars indicate a greater frequency of variants in the selected gene for the corresponding cancer type. Note that the same nsSNV reported by multiple sources are counted as distinct variants for each source, and therefore frequencies reported in the chart do not reflect unique variants by position/substitution. Hovering the mouse over a bar will display a pop-up containing the cancer name and number of variants associated with that bar. Only cancers with non-zero counts for the queried gene are displayed in the chart."
