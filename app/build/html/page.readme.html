<p>
BioMuta is an annotated database for single-nucleotide variations (SNVs)found in cancer. In BioMuta, variations are mapped to positions at genome, protein, and gene levels. The current BioMuta database (BioMuta v4.0) contains a total of 3,732,175 nonsynonymous SNVs (nsSNVs) reported in 18,986 genes across 42 cancer types in Disease Ontology. Please note - in the previous version (v3.0), a small number of variants were added to BioMuta following manual literature review of PubMed abstracts, resulting in an increase in the number of cancer types included in the database. We are in the process of updating our literature mining pipeline to include automatically mined associations from DiMeX, and we anticipate adding this information back to the database with the next release.
