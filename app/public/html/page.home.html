BioMuta is a single-nucleotide variation (SNV) and disease association database where variations are mapped to genomes and RefSeq nucleotide entries, and unified through UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot positional coordinates. The current version of BioMuta contains only nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variations (nsSNVs) associated with cancer.
